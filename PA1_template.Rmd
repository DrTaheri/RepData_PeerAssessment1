## Loading and preprocessing the data
In this part the raw data are imported to the R code. The data is in a .csv format in the acivity.csv file.

```{R}
raw_data <- read.csv(file='./activity/activity.csv')
head(raw_data)
mean(raw_data[,1], na.rm=TRUE)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
No we need to calculate the number of steps taken at each day. The tapply command is used to perfom this part.
```{R}
#lapply()
ta_mean <- tapply(raw_data[,1], raw_data[,2], mean, na.rm=TRUE)
head(ta_mean)
summary(ta_mean)
hist(ta_mean)

```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
